/* ── the curved row ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Scroll Tilted Grid turned on its side, with the tilt drawn as a curve.
 * One row of images streams from right to left around the inside of a
 * cylinder. The centre faces you flat, the ends bend toward you so each
 * end image curves along its length, and the ends fade into the page.
 *
 * A CSS box can't bend, so every tile is cut into SLICES vertical strips,
 * each a flat facet of the cylinder showing its share of the image. The
 * strips sit still inside their tile, each turned its own few degrees
 * round the cylinder's axis, and the tile (preserve-3d) is what moves: one
 * rotateY about that same axis carries the whole tile along the arc. A
 * tile is one animation, so its strips can never drift apart or show
 * different images. Only a tile's delay differs, and that sets where on
 * the arc it sits. The band is transform-only on the compositor; the fade
 * is a static mask over it.
 *
 * The only JS is a ResizeObserver that sizes the loop, and a handler that
 * hands a tile its next image each time it wraps, out of sight.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
